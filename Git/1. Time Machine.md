## 1. Modify the file content
Original file content :
```
Git is a version control system.
Git is free software.
```
Update to :
```
Git is a distributed version control system.
Git is free software.
```

`git status` The command allows us to keep track of the current status of the repository. (Staged / Unstage status)

`git diff <file name>` you can see the changes that has been modified.

> ### Summary  
> - To keep track of the status of your workspace at all times, use `git status` commands.
> - If `git status` it tells you that a file has been modified, `git diff` can view the modified content.

## 2. Version Rollback
Use `git log` command to view commit history

![git log](/Git/image/Screenshot-2025-03-28-222820.png)

Use `git log --pretty=oneline` when too dazzling

![git log](/Git/image/Screenshot-2025-03-28-224029.png)

The long string of similar numbers you see 1094adb...is `commit id`(version number)

<br>

1. Make readme.md rollback to `add distributed` version
- `HEAD` is the current version is represented by , which is the latest commit

- use `git reset --hard HEAD^`

`--hard` It will roll back to the last version's committed state

`--soft` will roll back to the last version's uncommitted state, and 

`--mixed` it will roll back to the last version's added but uncommitted state.

Check readme.txt if the content is the version add distributed:
- use `cat <file name>`

To restore the `append GPL`(cfcad45460d23c831be6178a6f5715916ce99de8) that have been reset:
- As long as the command line window above has not been closed, you can search up and find the one append GPLt commit id
- use `git reset --hard <commit id>`

When you forgot the commit id, you can use `git reflog` to find.

> ### Summary
> - `HEAD` The version pointed to is the current version, so Git allows us to shuttle between version histories using commands `git reset --hard <commit_id>`
> - Before reverting, `git log` can view the commit history to determine which version to revert to.
> - To go back to the future, use `git reflog` to view the command history so that you can determine which version in the future you want to go back to.


## 3. Undo Modification
`git checkout -- <file>` This command discard all changes to the file in the workspace / unstage changes.

`git reset HEAD <file>` can use commands to undo (unstage) the changes in the temporary storage area and put them back into the working area.
